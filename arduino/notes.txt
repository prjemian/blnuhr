Berlin Clock - hardware project
===============================

Basic display (R: red, O: orange)::

                  [O]
   [--R--]  [--R--] [--R--]  [--R--]
   [--R--]  [--R--] [--R--]  [--R--]
   [O][O][R][O][O][R][O][O][R][O][O]
   [--O--]  [--O--] [--O--]  [--O--]

* Need controls to set the current time.
  - could be just two buttons: mode & select
* and indication when the current time is not set.
* "Blinking 12:00" is the right metaphor.

Possible Implementations
========================

# LCD circuit
  - larger than touch screen
  - more expensive to produce custom circuit board
  - more labor to produce custom circuit board
  - design is closer to original implementation
  - I/O points require Arduino Mega (mega1280 or mega2560)

# Touch screen
  - faster to implement
  - compact design, easy to produce
  - smaller than LCD circuit
  - can use Arduino Uno
  - TFT screen graphics are primitive, needs more code
    + draw each graphic object using basic commands
	+ "clear" object by drawing background to that area
  - TFT touch interface is primitive
  - easier interface to set the time:
    + button to enter/exit mode to set the time
	+ touch the lights for the time configuration
	+ double-touch to clear the row

* display screen is 320x240
* need to map out the display
* 5 rows plus borders: 4 px wide, 40 px high colors
* 8 px border on left and right
* large rectangles: 40x73, 2 px border
* small rectangles: 40x24, 2 px border
* use "*" character to indicate "mode" button
* calibrate time to the minute by clicking the "seconds" blinker
